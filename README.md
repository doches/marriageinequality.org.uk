This is the server and front-end code for [MarriageInequality.org.uk](http://marriageinequality.org.uk), a 
protest website to call attention to the UK's financially discriminatory marriage laws. 

The server is written in Node.js, and answers all HTTP requests with a JSON object representing a possible immigration story.

The front-end is written in Coffeescript & LESS, using [Chassis](https://github.com/doches/chassis) for Gulpfile awesomeness.
